This provides some support files for building APM on normal desktop
systems. This makes it possible to use debugging tools (such as gdb
and valgrind) on the APM code

To build it do this:

  cd ArduPlane
  make -f ../libraries/Desktop/Makefile.desktop hil

currently only 'hil' builds work.

It currently runs with the first serial port mapped to
stdin/stdout. To test it, you can use mavproxy like this:

 mavproxy.py --master=/tmp/ArduPlane/ArduPlane.elf

that will run ArduPlane as a child process, and will give you the
ability to control ArduPlane over MAVLink.
